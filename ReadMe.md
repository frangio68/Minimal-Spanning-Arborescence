Readme file for Version 1.13 of MSArbor, a C++ implementation of the ARBOR
algorithm [M. Fischetti and P.Toth, ORSA J. on Computing 5(4), 1993] for the
Minimal Spanning Arborescence problem on complete graphs.

- msa15:      File containing an example of MSA instance (with 15 nodes)

The code is pretty much pure C++ with no bells and whistles, so it should
compile straight away on most systems. It has been primarily tested on g++.
Testing it on your system involves the following steps:

- edit MSArbor.h and check the "PUBLIC TYPES" section for relevant type
  definitions and the corresponding constants;

- edit the makefile for compiler name, switches and so on;

- type "make" in the directory to build the executable;

- type "MSArbor msa15" to compute the optimal solution of the instance
  described in the file msa15: the output should be
  
  15	  290
  5 9 6 11 14 3 9 6 7 0 0 4 10 2 
  
  indicating that the instance has 15 nodes, that the optimal spanning
  arborescence with root 14 is
  
  14 --> 4 --> 11 --> 3 --> 5 --> 0 -->  9 --> 1
                                  |      |
                                  |      ----> 6 --> 2 --> 13
                                  |            |
                                  |            ----> 7 -->  8
                                  |
                                  ----> 10 --> 12
  
  and that its cost is 290.
